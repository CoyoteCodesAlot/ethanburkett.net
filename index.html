            <p>I am a 16 year old full stack developer, I am currently working on discord projects and a restaraunt
                ordering process. I have been coding since I was 11, ever since then I fell in love with the way
                websites and programs have worked. Over the years I've learned many languages, including: Python, Java,
                C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I'm currently learning how to use Google's Firebase and more on
                how it works, I have a passion for back-end and working with databases.</p>
